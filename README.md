# Aprime calculator

**Calculates A' (A prime) for classified data against a model's prediction.**

This is very basic code
You must have the observation in the first column (y/n - only for the moment)
You must have the model prediction confidence in the second column

The data must be clean (no problems with any of the values for now and no missing values)

The file must be named classifier.csv in a data folder (within this folder).

Run using:

**ruby calculate.rb**
